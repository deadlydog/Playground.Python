# Playground.Python

This is just a a place for me to play around with Python.

Following [the W3Schools Python tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/).

## Installation / Setup

1. Install Python from <https://www.python.org/downloads/>, or from the Windows command line just use the command `winget install -e --id Python.Python.3`.
1. Install [the `Python` VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python).

Check which version of Python you have installed by running `python --version`.

## Running your code

- In VS Code, with your .py file open in the editor, just press `F5` to run the code.
- From the command line, run `python YourFile.py`, or `py YourFile.py`.
